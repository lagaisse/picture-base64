# picture-base64
This script displays in a web page base64 data and exif data from images. It even experiments image orientation.

This is a helpful tool when testing image upload and management.

Configuration
---------
1. git clone locally
3. Put your pictures in an accessible directory.
4. Setup the `$target_dir` variable in `index.php` with the path to the picture directory
5. Access the index.php from your browser

But I don't have any picture !

This script works well with the examples from [Dave Perrett](https://github.com/recurser/exif-orientation-examples/)
