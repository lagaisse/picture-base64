# picture-base64
A very simple php script that displays base64 data and exif data from images and that performs image re-orientation based on the exif metadata "Orientation".

Configuration
---------
1. git clone locally or download the zip
3. Put your pictures in an accessible directory.
4. Setup the `$target_dir` variable in `index.php` with the path to the image directory
5. Access the index.php from your browser

But I don't have any image !

This script works well with the sample images from [Dave Perrett](https://github.com/recurser/exif-orientation-examples/)
